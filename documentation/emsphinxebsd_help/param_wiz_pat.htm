<h1>Parameter Wizard - Experimental Pattern Selection</h1>

<h3>Pattern File</h3>
<p>File to read EBSD patterns from. HDF5 (.h5, .hdf, .hdf5), EDAX (.up1, .up2), Oxford (.ebsp), and EMsoft (.data) files are supported. The pattern dimensions, bitdepth, and number of patterns will be determined automatically for all files except EMsoft raw files. Additional meta data will be parsed depending on file type</p>
<ul>
  <li>HDF5 EBSD scan files</li>
  <li>EDAX files when there is a .ang with the same path/name</li>
  <li>Oxford files when there is a .ctf with the same path/name</li>
</ul>
<p>The following additional metadata will be read and prepopulated if possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>pattern center calibration</li>
  <li>detector tilt</li>
  <li>scan dimensions</li>
  <li>scan pixel size</li>
  <li>Pattern quality and indexing confidence maps (for ROI selection)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pattern Info</h3>
<p>Detector geometry will be automatically determined for most file formats. Raw binary files require specifying the pattern size.</p>
<h3>Image Processing</h3>
<p>The easiest way to select parameters is with the 'Preview...' button. When the button is clicked 'Preview Count' evenly spaced patterns will be read from the file. The raw pattern is displayed on the left and the processed pattern on the right. Change which pattern is displayed with the scroll bar and adjust parameter values below. If the dialog is closed with the 'OK' button the current values will be populated into the wizard, otherwise they will be discarded.</p>
<p>If your pattern file doesn't have associated maps for ROI selection you can tick the 'Compute Image Quality Map for ROI Selection' box to calculate IQ during pattern loading. If the box is ticked a computed IQ map will be available on the 'Scan Geometry' page.</p>
