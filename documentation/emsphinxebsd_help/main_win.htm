<h1>Main Window</h1>

<p>The main window consists of a menu bar (top), live indexing result (left), indexing parameters (right), and progress/status bar (bottom). To index an EBSD scan first specify the parameters by editing the summary panel directly, loading a namelist file, and/or using the wizard. Once the parameters are specified hit the 'Start' button and indexing will begin.</p>

<p>Indexer initialization may take several minutes on the first run as fourier transforms are being planned. To preplan ffts use the ShtWisdom program. You cancel indexing before it is complete, but the completed results will be lost.</p>
